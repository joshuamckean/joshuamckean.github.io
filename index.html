    <p style="color:aquamarine;text-align:center">What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class
        in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed
        kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to
        me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen
        before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the
        Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP
        is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic
        little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in
        over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed
        combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full
        extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known
        what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held
        your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will
        shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.</p>
